# ☁️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether rainfall will occur based on meteorological data using a machine learning classification model.

##  Overview

Rainfall prediction is an important aspect of weather forecasting that helps in planning agricultural activities, disaster management, and water resource management. In this project, a classification model is trained on weather data to predict rainfall.
